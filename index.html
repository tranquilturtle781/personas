                <p>In a nutshell, an elevator control panel provide users with the ability to partially control an elevator.</p>
                <p>This particular interface is located in the main elevator of the CIT at Brown University. It has buttons that allow users to set their desired destination, operate the doors, and request assistance in the event of an emergency.</p>
                <p>This panel also has the added functionality of a ID card reader, giving users the ability to gain access to restricted floors if they have been given permission.</p>

            <h2>Observing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Some users quickly press the buttons they need, but others, possibly newer users, clearly hesitate while looking for the buttons to select</li>
                <li>The first floor rear button is rarely used</li>
                <li>The "door open" button is a key feature, used nearly as often as the floor selections</li>
                <li>Card swipes, when used, often required multiple attempts to achieve the desired outcome</li>

                <p>Friendly Fiona doesn't come to the CIT very often, but when she does, she tries to help others out. The elevators are busy, and if she sees someone rushing to make the elevator, she tries to hold the door for them. But, she struggles with the buttons and ends up letting the door close in their face.</p>
                <p>Friendly Fiona represents the inexperienced users that don't use the CIT elevator often. She illustrates the struggles users shared regarding unintuitive buttons.</p>

            <p>Tom is a teaching assistant who holds TA hours in the CIT. He is also a busy student who is always running late! Tom has used this elevator several times per week for the last year, but he struggles with the card swipe nearly every time he uses the elevator after hours (and he doesn't even know what time "after hours" starts!).</p>
            <p>Tom exemplifies the users that struggle with the card swiping element of this interface due a lack of clear usage instructions.</p>
